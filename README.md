# Problem Description

## The problem
This folder template is for me to generate a consistent reference to use for producing my work.

That consistency will make it easier for other to find what they want from my analyses and model-building.

The target audience for this readme is for someone else aiming to read and understand a very brief intro on why this analysis was done,
and then more detail on what was done and the sources used.

## Stakeholders

# Description on data used

# Expected derivatives

# Considerations through development
## Critical assumptions

## Major dependencies

## Known issues and limitations

## Key results / outcomes
